## Project Information: ##
* Our task as a group was to build a frontend for a backend application built by another BNTA team, [Blue Chicken FM](https://github.com/zahir679/Project-API), using the React library, JavaScript, and CSS. 
* This was done over the course of one week before presenting and doing a demo of our finished before colleagues and clients. 
* The backend is a music API built in Java that features a database of artists, albums, and songs. It features key CRUD operations. 

## Key Features: ##
* Application fetches data from API and renders it on the page. 
* User can add artists, albums, and songs to the database through our app, as well as filter through a search bar by artist name etc. 
* Mobile friendly, responsive design for most of the application. 
* Light and dark mode, as well as hidden colour modes (try clicking on the chickens on our Album page!). 
* Multi-page app using React Router (v5). 

## Challenges Faced: ##
* First time working as a group to build a full React application. 
* Limited scope to implement some features, such as allowing users to favourite a song and add it to a playlist, as part of the task was to not edit the backend in any way. 
* Ensuring mobile friendly responsive design for every part of the application. 

## Ideas for Future Features: ## 
* Adding favourite song functionality.
* Map individual album/artist/song art onto relevant components - perhaps through use of an external API. 
* Connecting to an external API in order to play songs through our application. 
* Use of library like React Transition Group to improve page transitions done through React Router.
